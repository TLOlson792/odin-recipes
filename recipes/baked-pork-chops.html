    <h2>Quick and Easy 3 Ingredient Pork Chops!</h2>

    <p>Exciting news—you’re just three ingredients away from a magnificently meaty main dish! This crispy, oven-baked pork chop recipe works just as well for boneless, center-cut pork chops, simply check them after 10-15 minutes and be sure not to let them overcook</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 bone-in center-cut pork chops</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 cup italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk eggs in a shallow dish. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper, if desired. Dip pork chops in eggs, and allow excess to drip off. Coat pork chops in breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Place pork chops on a baking rack lightly coated with cooking spray; set rack in a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a thermometer inserted in thickest portion registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
